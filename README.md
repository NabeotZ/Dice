This program is a dice rolling game where the user rolls three dice. The user decides if they want to play by entering "Y" to begin, otherwise the program ends. If "Y" is selected, game starts. Three dice are rolled, and it is seen whether all the dice show the same value, if one die has a different result, or if all the dice rolled differently. Users can then choose to reroll the dice to improve their total score or end the game with what they have. The game keeps going until the user decides to end it or all dice roll the same, resulting in a tuple out and zero points. The user has control over whether to reroll or not after the dice rolls, as well as whether to start the game or not. Using time, the game marks down when you start the game, the current time during the game, and the game end time for the user to see. Numpy is also used to calculate the sum and totals.
